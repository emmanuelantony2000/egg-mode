/// The `RawDirectMessage` type is used in the process of converting from `EventCursor` or
/// `SingleEvent` into a `DirectMessage`. They can be directly loaded from a `DMEvent` struct, but
/// require a mapping of source-app IDs to convert fully into a `DirectMessage`. By giving this
/// mapping to the `into_dm` function, you can convert a `RawDirectMessage` into the final
/// `DirectMessage` type.
///
/// Another way `RawDirectMessage` differs from `DirectMessage` is how its entities are stored.
/// Twitter returns entity information based on *codepoint* indices, whereas Rust Strings are
/// indexed using *byte* indices. egg-mode translates these indices for you when returning a
/// processed type, but that translation has not occurred when a `RawDirectMessage` has been
/// created. The `translate_indices` function can be used to perform this translation if the
/// `RawDirectMessage` is being used directly. The `into_dm` conversion function also performs this
/// translation before returning the final `DirectMessage`.
