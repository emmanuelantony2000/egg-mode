//! Structs and methods for working with direct messages.
//!
//! Note that direct message access requires a special permissions level above regular read/write
//! access. Your app must be configured to have "read, write, and direct message" access to use any
//! function in this module, even the read-only ones.
//!
//! In some sense, DMs are simpler than Tweets, because there are fewer ways to interact with them
//! and less metadata stored with them. However, there are also separate DM-specific capabilities
//! that are available, to allow users to create a structured conversation for things like
//! customer-service, interactive storytelling, etc. The extra DM-specific facilities are
//! documented in their respective builder functions on `DraftMessage`.
//!
//! ## Types
//!
//! * `DirectMessage`: The primary representation of a DM as retrieved from Twitter. Contains the
//!   types `DMEntities`/`Cta`/`QuickReply` as fields.
//! * `Timeline`: Returned by `list`, this is how you load a user's Direct Messages. Contains
//!   adapters to consume the collection as a `Stream` or to load it into a `DMConversations`
//!   collection.
//! * `DraftMessage`: As DMs have many optional parameters when creating them, this builder struct
//!   allows you to build up a DM before sending it.
//!
//! ## Functions
//!
//! * `list`: This creates a `Timeline` struct to load a user's Direct Messages.
//! * `show`: This allows you to load a single DM from its ID.
//! * `delete`: This allows you to delete a DM from a user's own views. Note that it will not
//!   delete it entirely from the system; the recipient will still have a copy of the message.
//! * `mark_read`: This sends a read receipt for a given message to a given user. This also has the
//!   effect of clearing the message's "unread" status for the authenticated user.
//! * `indicate_typing`: This sends a typing indicator to a given user, to indicate that the
//!   authenticated user is typing or thinking of a response.
